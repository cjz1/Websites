            Frequently Asked Questions:
          </h1>
          <p>
            Does this business help animals? <br>
            All of our profits are used making the business work better, and assisting animals achieve their life goals of making others happy. <br>
            <br>
    
            Can I send these pictures to other people? <br>
            Once you have bought an image, you are free to do whatever you would like with it. 
            We enforce no copyright infringement because we have no copyright on them. <br>
            <br>
    
            Can I give you pictures of my own pets? <br>
            Of course! We would love to see them, and if available, we would be willing to post them as well!
            If you would like to send us pictures, please do so at: TomsPics@TomsMarket.com <br>
            <br>
    
            Why are you only a dog market? <br>
            This is not out because we don't love other animals, we absolutely love them. 
            We are starting as a dog market as they are the most profitable pet market to currently be in, but once we are able to expand, we shall soon reach into other pet markets.
            You can send us suggestions of what you would like to see next at: TomsSuggests@TomsMarket.com <br>
            <br>
    
            What is your favorite dog breed? <br>
            We have differing opinions around the office, it is impossible to get a good answer.
            To put it easily, we love all dogs.
            We can hold no favorites because they're all so amazing. <br>
