          <h3 class="feature-title">Ann</h3>
          <p>
            Ann is one of, if not, the hardest working individuals in our office.
            Along with working long and hard hours, she knows how to make anyone smile, no matter what else is happening in their lives.
            If one ever gets the chance, she is one of the best friends you can find, in or out of work.

            <h3 class="feature-title">Kaya</h3>
          <p>
            Kaya has been with us since the founding of our company for her ability to make anyone feel welcome.
            No one can feel left out when she is around and feeling good.
            She gives off positive vibes everybody can see.

            <h3 class="feature-title">Jasper</h3>
            <p>
              Jasper is honestly a terrible worker, but at least he's cute at it.
              He accomplishes absolutely nothing for this service, except for great motivation.
              He is the equivalent to our support animal, but he is really good at being that support animal.

          <h3 class="feature-title">Ember</h3>
          <p>
            Ember gets a lot done in our office, but she is very scared of others.
            She prefers to work alone in a cubicle as opposed to being with the rest of the group.
            That said, she is very focused and gets her portion of the work done very well.

            <h3 class="feature-title">Mika</h3>
          <p>
            Mika is a fantastic worker when she has people around her.
            She provides great teamwork and assistance when needed.
            Just make sure not to leave her alone for too long at a time.
